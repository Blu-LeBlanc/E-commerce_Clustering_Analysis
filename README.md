# [E-Commerce Clustering Analysis]

## Overview
Performed extensive EDA on E-commerce data. Utilized various unsupervised learning clustering techniques to identify and extract business insights from the data.

## Data
- Kaggle dataset of OLIST (Brazilian E-Commerce company)
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce/data
- Viewed the data, cleaned up the data, transformed the data, performed feature analysis

## Methods
- Models: K-means Clustering, Hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN clustering
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, pyplot, seaborn, sklearn

## Results
- Used silhouette score and Davies-Bouldin index to compare models
- Found the Hierarchical model to be the best
- Used customer segments to find basic business insights
- Visualizations (embed plots) Not sure If I need them


## Key Learnings
- Great practice with exploratory data analysis and data transformation with pandas
- Learned how to set up clustering models with sklearn and how to evaluate them
- Practiced finding actionable insights from clustering models.
